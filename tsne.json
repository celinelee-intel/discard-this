Many neural language models have achieved promising results in completion suggestion prediction on synthetic benchmarks. However, a recent study When Code Completion Fails: a Case Study on Real-World Completions demonstrates that these results may not translate to improvements in real-world performance. To combat this effect, we train models on real-world code completion examples and find that these models outperform models trained on committed source code and working version snapshots by 12.8% and 13.8% accuracy respectively. We observe this improvement across modeling technologies and show through A/B testing that it corresponds to a 6.2% increase in programmers\u2019 actual autocompletion usage. Furthermore, our study characterizes a large corpus of logged autocompletion usages to investigate why training on real-world examples leads to stronger models.</p>\n", "tags": ["autocomplete"], "tsne_embedding": [0.9572592377662659, -7.973575115203857]}, {"key": "aye2020sequence", "year": "2020", "title": "Sequence Model Design for Code Completion in the Modern IDE", "abstract": "<p>Code completion plays a prominent role in modern integrated development environments (IDEs).

However, many standard ML approaches require a numeric representation of data and cannot be applied directly to source code. Thus, to enable ML, we need to embed source code into numeric feature vectors while maintaining the semantics of the code as much as possible. code2vec is a recently released embedding approach that uses the proxy task of method name prediction to map Java methods to feature vectors. However, experimentation with code2vec shows that it learns to rely on variable names for prediction, causing it to be easily fooled by typos or adversarial attacks. Moreover, it is only able to embed individual Java methods and cannot embed an entire collection of methods such as those present in a typical Java class, making it difficult to perform predictions at the class level (e.g., for the identification of malicious Java classes). Both shortcomings are addressed in the research presented in this paper.

Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda1, the first end-to-end neural-based framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into of two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior with performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda\u2019s performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art decompilers yield 0% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70% program accuracy.

Meanwhile, deep learning-based code search still suffers from three main problems, i.e., the OOV (Out of Vocabulary) problem, the independent similarity matching problem, and the small training dataset problem. To tackle the above problems, we propose CQIL, a novel, deep learning-based code search method. CQIL learns code-query interactions and uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to compute semantic correlations between queries and code snippets. In particular, CQIL employs a hybrid representation to model code-query correlations, which solves the OOV problem. CQIL also deeply learns the code-query interaction for enhancing code searches, which solves the independent similarity matching and the small training dataset problems. We evaluate CQIL on two datasets (CODEnn and CosBench). The evaluation results show the strengths of CQIL-it achieves the MAP@1 values, 0.694 and 0.574, on CODEnn and CosBench, respectively.

Since it is impossible to test neural program analyzers on all unforeseen programs, in this paper, we propose to evaluate the generalizability of neural program analyzers with respect to semantic-preserving transformations: a generalizable neural program analyzer should perform equally well on programs that are of the same semantics but of different lexical appearances and syntactical structures. More specifically, we compare the results of various neural program analyzers for the method name prediction task on programs before and after automated semantic-preserving transformations.

Most popular fuzzers use evolutionary guidance to generate inputs that can trigger different bugs. Such evolutionary algorithms, while fast and simple to implement, often get stuck in fruitless sequences of random mutations. Gradient-guided optimization presents a promising alternative to evolutionary guidance. Gradient-guided techniques have been shown to significantly outperform evolutionary algorithms at solving high-dimensional structured optimization problems in domains like machine learning by efficiently utilizing gradients or higher-order derivatives of the underlying function. However, gradient-guided approaches are not directly applicable to fuzzing as real-world program behaviors contain many discontinuities, plateaus, and ridges where the gradient-based methods often get stuck. We observe that this problem can be addressed by creating a smooth surrogate function approximating the discrete branching behavior of target program. In this paper, we propose a novel program smoothing technique using surrogate neural network models that can incrementally learn smooth approximations of a complex, real-world program\u2019s branching behaviors.

At the core of code representations often are word embeddings of identifier names in source code, because identifiers account for the majority of source code vocabulary and convey important semantic information. Unfortunately, there currently is no generally accepted way of evaluating the quality of word embeddings of identifiers, and current evaluations are biased toward specific downstream tasks. This paper presents IdBench, the first benchmark for evaluating to what extent word embeddings of identifiers represent semantic relatedness and similarity. The benchmark is based on thousands of ratings gathered by surveying 500 software developers. We use IdBench to evaluate state-of-the-art embedding techniques proposed for natural language, an embedding technique specifically designed for source code, and lexical string distance functions, as these are often used in current developer tools. Our results show that the effectiveness of embeddings varies significantly across different embedding techniques and that the best available embeddings successfully represent semantic relatedness. On the downside, no existing embedding provides a satisfactory representation of semantic similarities, e.g., because embeddings consider identifiers with opposing meanings as similar, which may lead to fatal mistakes in downstream developer tools.

Traditional information retrieval based methods often treat programs as natural language texts, which could miss important semantic information of source code.

However, the sizes of ASTs are usually large and the existing models are prone to the long-term dependency problem. In this paper, we propose a novel AST-based Neural Network (ASTNN) for source code representation. Unlike existing models that work on entire ASTs, ASTNN splits each large AST into a sequence of small statement trees, and encodes the statement trees to vectors by capturing the lexical and syntactical knowledge of statements. Based on the sequence of statement vectors, a bidirectional RNN model is used to leverage the naturalness of statements and finally produce the vector representation of a code fragment.
